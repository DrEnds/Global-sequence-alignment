st.write("The Needleman-Wunsch method is a bioinformatics tool used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. That was one of the first times dynamic programming was used to compare biological sequences. Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch created the algorithm, which was published in 1970. The method breaks a major problem into smaller problems, and then uses the answers to the smaller problems to discover an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also known as the optimum matching algorithm and the global alignment approach. The Needleman-Wunsch method is still commonly employed for optimum global alignment, especially where global alignment quality is critical. The method assigns a score to each potential alignment, and its goal is to identify all possible alignments with the highest score.")
